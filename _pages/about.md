I am an undergraduate Oxford Engineering student, originally from Bologna, Italy. I am currently working on my senior thesis within [Princeton’s](https://www.princeton.edu/) [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE)](https://mae.princeton.edu/) department, under the cross-departmental supervision of [Bartolomeo Stellato](https://stella.to/group/). I have previously carried out two fully-funded research projects within the [Oxford Control Group](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/control/), in collaboration with [Kostas Margellos](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/kostas-margellos/) and [Idris Kempf](https://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/people/idris-kempf/).

My research interests revolve around the fields of optimisation, control, machine learning, and their intersection. In particular, my current work focuses on conformal performance guarantees of first-order methods for parametric optimisation problems. I am most interested in real-time and safety-critical applications within uncertain environments, and devising high-throughput algorithms using data to inform decisions.

I am also passionate about aeronautical engineering and space exploration: in 2024, I co-founded the [Oxford Aerospace and Rocketry Society (OARS)](https://www.oxfordaerospaceandrocketry.co.uk/), Oxford's first rocket team. I was also the 87th president of the [Oxford University Gliding Club (OUGC)](https://ougc.org/about_ougc/alumni_1937_club/), the oldest student aviation club in the UK.

I will graduate from the University of Oxford in May 2026.
